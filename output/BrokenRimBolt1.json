      "asset": "CAT D6N Dozer",
      "status": "fail",
      "overall_operational_impact": "Machine is non-operational pending immediate inspection of multi-piece rim lock ring and bead seat band. A confirmed or suspected lock ring gap presents an extreme explosive decompression hazard to personnel. Secondary corrosion damage across the wheel rim assembly, bead seat band, and lug nut fasteners further compromises structural and torque integrity. Do not inflate, operate, or position personnel near the tire assembly until a qualified technician completes a hands-on evaluation and clears the unit for service."

      {
        "component": "Multi-piece rim lock ring / bead seat band",
        "component_location": "Upper-right quadrant of the wheel rim assembly, undercarriage side",
        "issue": "Lock ring gap or separation detected \u2014 extreme explosion hazard",
        "condition_description": "AI vision analysis identified a visible gap or separation between the lock ring or bead seat band and the rim base in the upper-right quadrant of the multi-piece rim assembly. Active corrosion is present across the seating interface and may have compromised the lock ring seating integrity. Multi-piece rims with unseated or displaced lock rings are known to present a catastrophic explosive decompression risk during inflation events or when subjected to operational load. Technician voice transcript references extensive rust and pitting affecting mounting surfaces, which is consistent with degraded seating conditions, however the specific lock ring separation finding was not explicitly confirmed by voice input, resulting in an evidence conflict requiring mandatory hands-on technician verification before any further action.",
        "severity": "Critical",
        "safety_impact_assessment": "Extreme risk to personnel. An unseated or separated lock ring on a pressurized multi-piece rim assembly can result in sudden explosive separation of rim components, causing fatal or life-altering injury to anyone in the vicinity. No inflation, deflation, or tire servicing should be performed until the lock ring seating is physically verified and confirmed secure by a qualified rim technician following all applicable safety protocols including use of a restraining device.",
        "operational_impact": "Machine must not be operated. Rim structural integrity cannot be confirmed. Operation under load with a compromised lock ring risks catastrophic wheel assembly failure, loss of machine control, and potential fatality.",
        "estimated_timeline": "Replace immediately before next operation",
        "recommended_action": "Tag machine out of service immediately. Do not inflate or approach the tire without a restraining device in place. Assign a qualified technician to physically inspect and verify lock ring seating condition per CAT multi-piece rim service procedures. If separation is confirmed, remove tire, deflate safely using a cage or restraining device, inspect and replace the lock ring and bead seat band before returning to service.",

        "component_location": "Full rim face, bead seat band, and flange area \u2014 all quadrants",
        "issue": "Extensive surface corrosion, paint failure, and debris accumulation on rim structure",
        "condition_description": "Significant surface corrosion and active oxidation observed across the entire rim face, bead seat band, and flange area. Paint coating has failed extensively with no remaining protective barrier evident across large surface regions. Active rust pitting is present, consistent with technician voice report of extensive rust and pitting affecting integrity and mounting surfaces. Organic debris including grass and packed dirt is observed in the rim well area between the bead seat band and hub face, contributing to moisture retention and accelerating ongoing corrosion. Pitting severity may compromise structural wall thickness and bead seating surfaces.",
        "severity": "Moderate",
        "safety_impact_assessment": "Elevated risk to personnel and operator. Progressive corrosion and pitting on a multi-piece rim assembly can weaken structural integrity and bead seating surfaces, increasing the probability of rim failure under load or during inflation. Debris retention accelerates corrosion and may mask developing cracks or deformation.",
        "operational_impact": "Continued operation without treatment accelerates structural degradation of the rim assembly. Compromised bead seating surfaces may lead to air loss, bead unseating, or rim failure under operational load.",
        "estimated_timeline": "Address within 50 operating hours or 2 weeks",
        "recommended_action": "Clean all debris from the rim well, bead seat band interface, and hub face. Conduct a detailed visual and tactile inspection of all rim surfaces for pitting depth, cracks, and deformation. Wire brush and treat active rust areas. Apply approved protective coating following CAT rim refurbishment procedures. If pitting depth exceeds serviceable limits per the applicable CAT service manual, replace the rim assembly.",

        "issue": "Heavy corrosion and rust staining on lug nut fasteners \u2014 torque retention and removability at risk",
        "condition_description": "Approximately 18 to 20 lug nut fasteners visible around the hub bolt circle exhibit heavy surface corrosion and rust staining. No obviously missing fasteners were detected by AI vision analysis. However, the extent of corrosion may have degraded torque retention capacity, compromised thread engagement, and significantly reduced the ability to safely remove fasteners for service without fastener failure or seizure. Voice transcript does not reference fastener condition directly; finding is vision-sourced only.",
        "severity": "Moderate",
        "safety_impact_assessment": "Moderate risk. Corroded fasteners with compromised torque retention may allow wheel movement or separation under load. Seized fasteners also delay emergency removal of the wheel assembly during breakdown or service, increasing technician injury risk during forced removal attempts.",
        "operational_impact": "If lug nut torque has been compromised by corrosion, wheel fastening integrity cannot be confirmed. Wheel movement under operational load may cause stud damage, elongated bolt holes, or wheel separation.",
        "estimated_timeline": "Address within 50 operating hours or 2 weeks",
        "recommended_action": "Torque verify all accessible lug nuts to the CAT D6N specified torque value using a calibrated torque wrench. Apply penetrating lubricant to corroded fasteners and allow adequate dwell time before attempting removal. Replace any fasteners that are cracked, stripped, or cannot achieve specified torque. Do not apply lubricant to torque-to-yield fasteners without confirming compatibility with CAT specifications.",

      "overall_operational_impact": "Machine is non-operational pending inspection and replacement of critically degraded rim structure. Extensive rust and pitting compromises rim integrity and mounting surfaces, presenting immediate risk of wheel/track assembly failure and operator safety hazard. Do not operate until corrective action is completed."

        "condition_description": "Technician reported extensive rust and pitting observed across the rim structure, affecting both structural integrity and mounting surfaces. Corrosion penetration is consistent with advanced material degradation that may compromise load-bearing capacity and secure attachment of track or wheel assembly components. No visual confirmation available; findings derived solely from technician voice transcript.",
        "severity": "Critical",
        "safety_impact_assessment": "Degraded rim integrity and compromised mounting surfaces present a significant risk of sudden track or wheel assembly detachment during operation, potentially causing loss of machine control, personnel injury, or fatality to the operator and ground personnel in proximity.",
        "operational_impact": "Machine is unsafe for operation. Rim structural failure under load could result in complete loss of drive train engagement, track disengagement, or catastrophic undercarriage collapse, leading to extended downtime and major component damage.",
        "estimated_timeline": "Replace immediately before next operation",
        "recommended_action": "Remove machine from service immediately. Perform a hands-on physical inspection of the full rim circumference and all mounting surfaces to quantify rust depth and pitting extent. Replace rim assembly if material loss exceeds CAT D6N service tolerances. Do not return machine to operation until rim is certified serviceable or replaced.",

# SUBSECTION PROMPT: STRUCTURAL
# Context: Frame, welds, ROPS, bucket, attachment points, articulation joints

## INSPECTION SCOPE
Machine frame, weld seams, ROPS/FOPS cab structure, boom/stick/bucket
(if excavator), articulation joint (if articulated), hitch and attachment points.

## 🔴 CRITICAL
- Frame crack or weld failure at stress concentrations
- ROPS/FOPS deformation or crack (operator protection failure)
- Structural member bending under normal operating load
- Articulation joint cracking or pin shear
- Bucket structural failure: cracked back, separated side plates, lip cracking

## 🟡 MODERATE
- Surface corrosion on structural members (not through-wall)
- Minor cosmetic dents not in load path
- Hairline paint cracks (confirm metal below with tap test)
- Worn pivot pins or attachment bushings

## ✅ NORMAL
- Frame intact, continuous welds, no deformation
- All hardware torqued, no missing fasteners
- Normal surface wear and oxidation within spec

## KEY DETECTION POINTS
- Inspect corner welds, frame articulation zones, hitch points under paint breaks
- StructuralDamage.jpg: look for bent frame rails, separated weld beads

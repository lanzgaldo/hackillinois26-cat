# SUBSECTION PROMPT: UNDERCARRIAGE
# Context: Track links, shoes, sprockets, idlers, carrier rollers, frame rails

## INSPECTION SCOPE
Track assembly (links, pins, bushings, shoes/pads), drive sprockets,
front idlers, carrier rollers, bottom rollers, track frame rails.
Applies to tracked equipment only (excavators, dozers, compact track loaders).

## 🔴 CRITICAL
- Track shoe cracking through shoe body or separated from link
- Broken track link (chain separation imminent)
- Sprocket: >60% tooth wear, broken tooth, or missing tooth
- Idler/roller seal failure: oil leaking from carrier or bottom roller
- Track derailed or sag exceeding manufacturer spec (typically >2–3 inches at midpoint)

## 🟡 MODERATE
- Track tension outside spec (sagging but not derailed)
- Sprocket teeth 40–60% worn (schedule replacement)
- Pin and bushing elongation (link pitch increased beyond spec)
- Roller flange wear causing track wander
- Track pad wear (wear indicator bolts exposed, shoe body intact)

## ✅ NORMAL
- Track tension within spec
- Shoe/pad thickness above minimum wear indicator
- Sprocket tooth profile intact, proper engagement
- Rollers and idlers sealed (no oil weeping), clean external surfaces
- Track tracking straight on rollers

## FIELD PATTERNS
- Excavators: check idler flange wear → track wander on rollers
- Dozers: measure track sag at center span between sprocket and idler
- All tracked: verify master link clip orientation (open end trailing)

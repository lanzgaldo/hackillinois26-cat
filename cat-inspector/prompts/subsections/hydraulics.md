# SUBSECTION PROMPT: HYDRAULICS
# Context: Hydraulic hoses, cylinders, fittings, brackets, seals, fluid tank

## INSPECTION SCOPE
Hydraulic hoses, lines, fittings, cylinders (rod + body), brackets,
mounting hardware, seals, fluid tank, filtration system.

## 🔴 CRITICAL
- Active hydraulic fluid leak: pooling, streaming, spray pattern on surroundings
- Hydraulic hose damage: kinking, abrasion through armor, bulging, crush damage
- Fitting failure: cracked body, cross-threaded, separated from line
- Cylinder rod: scoring, deep pitting, seal extrusion visible
- Bracket failure: cracked, bent, fasteners missing (component unsupported)
- Contaminated fluid: milky (water intrusion), metallic sheen (component wear)

## 🟡 MODERATE
- Surface rust on brackets: not through-wall, monitor for structural impact
- Minor seepage at fittings: damp but not dripping
- Hose chafing: armor worn but inner liner not exposed
- Fluid discoloration: darkened but not contaminated

## ✅ NORMAL
- Dry components, no fluid trails
- Hoses properly routed and secured (no contact with hot or moving parts)
- Fittings tight, no seepage
- Brackets intact, all hardware present and tight
- Fluid level at spec, clean appearance

## FIELD PATTERNS
- RustOnHydraulicComponentBracket → surface corrosion on bracket → Moderate if surface only, Critical if through-wall
- HydraulicHose → inspect armor condition, routing clearance from pinch points
- HydraulicFluidTank → check sight glass level, check for external seepage
- HydraulicFluidFiltrationSystem → check bypass indicator, filter condition

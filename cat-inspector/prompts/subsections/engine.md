# SUBSECTION PROMPT: ENGINE AND FILTERS
# Context: Engine compartment, air/fuel/hydraulic filters, belts, oil system

## 🔴 CRITICAL
- Active engine oil leak from gaskets, seals, or drain plug
- Air filter bypass: damaged element, missing housing seal, debris on clean side
- Fuel filter saturation / bypass indicator active
- Belt: cracking through plies, separated, fraying, or loss of tension
- Excessive blowby or breather mist (heavy oil vapor)
- Housing seal failure: gap, extrusion, or weeping at housing joint

## 🟡 MODERATE
- Filter approaching service interval (hours vs. manufacturer spec)
- Belt glazing or minor surface cracking (not through-ply)
- Minor oil seepage at valve cover or pan gasket (damp, not dripping)
- Air filter element loaded but not bypassing
- Debris accumulation near hot surfaces

## ✅ NORMAL
- Engine compartment dry, clean surfaces
- Filter elements seated with intact seals
- Belts at proper tension, no cracking visible
- No fluid trails on block or compartment panels

## FIELD PATTERNS
- HousingSeal images: check for oil weeping line, seal lip extrusion
- HydraulicFluidFiltrationSystem: check bypass indicator button (red = bypassing = Critical)
- Air filter: outer element collapse = Critical; inner safety element breach = Critical
